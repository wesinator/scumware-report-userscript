# Scumware report userscript
Browser script that will automatically offer to download URL data from a [Scumware.org](https://www.scumware.org/) report page.

I wanted a way to save scumware.org report data persistently, since the site seems to remove old reports, and the static page is obfuscated to prevent scraping.
